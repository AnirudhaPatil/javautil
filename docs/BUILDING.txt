PREREQUISITES:
--------------

Before building this library, you'll need:

1. ant, version 1.5 or better, available at http://ant.apache.org/

2. The Apache Jakarta ORO regular expression library. See
   http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/

3. The Java Mail API, which, in turn, requires the Java Activation Framework.
   See http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/ 
   and http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/jaf/index.jsp

   This component is optional. See OPTIONAL COMPONENTS, below.


BUILDING.
---------

Type "ant dist" in the top-level directory. The code will be compiled to
the "classes" subdirectory, and you'll get an "curn.jar" in "dist/lib".

The ant "build.xml" file is set to use jikes as the Java compiler. If you
don't have jikes, or you would rather use the javac compiler, remove or
remove or comment out the following line in "build.xml":

        <property name="build.compiler" value="jikes"/>


POSSIBLE BUILD ERRORS:

1. If you see the following error:

BUILD FAILED
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/example/somepackage/SomeClass (Unsupported major.minor version 48.0)

   it usually means that you're compiling with a 1.2 or 1.3 JDK, and you're
   using a third-party jar that was built with a 1.4 or greater JDK.

   To solve this problem, either:

   a) Use a 1.4 JDK to build the org.clapper.util library,
   b) Get a copy of the third-party library that was built with an older JDK, 
      or
   c) Rebuild the third-party library from source (if possible), using the
      same JDK you want to use to build the org.clapper.util library

2. If you see this error during the build

	assertion "! array" failed: file "tuple.h", line 429

   you've encountered a jikes bug. I've seen this happen with jikes 1.21.
   Others on the net report the error with jikes 1.20.

   To solve this problem, either:

   a) Build with javac, not jikes
   b) Back off to an older version of jikes. (jikes 1.15 works fine for me.)


OPTIONAL COMPONENTS:
--------------------

A. Email support

The org.clapper.util library contains a set of classes that provide a
simplified front-end to the Java Mail API (in the org.clapper.mail
package). This package can only be built if the Java Mail API and the Java
Activation Framework are present.
