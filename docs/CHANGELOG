Version 1.1 (...):

- Now requires JDK 1.4 or better. JDK 1.3 is no longer supported. Among
  the reasons for this requirement:

  * I wanted to use the new assertion capabilities of 1.4

  * The regular expression classes that come with 1.4 are more extensible
    than the Jakarta ORO classes, in that they work with anything that
    implements the CharSequence interface, not just with Strings. Plus,
    using java.util.regexp, instead of Jakarta ORO, removes a third-party
    library dependency.

  * The JDK 1.4 version of String introduces a split() method, obviating
    the need to provide those methods in TextUtil.

- Converted code that used Jakarta ORO to use the 1.4 java.util.regexp
  classes.

- Removed TextUtil.split() methods. JDK 1.4's String class has its own
  methods.

- Overhauled build.xml to make compilations more efficient. Requires a
  newer version of Jikes (if compiling with Jikes).

- Cleaned up a lot of unnecessary imports. Addressed minor issues that
  Jikes warned about.

- Minor javadoc changes and adjustments.


Version 1.0.2 (24 September, 2004):

- Drastically simplified word-wrapping logic in org.clapper.io.WordWrapWriter.
- Added rightJustifyString(), leftJustifyString() and centerString() methods
  to org.clapper.util.text.TextUtil.
- Added org.clapper.util.io.JustifyTextWriter class.


Version 1.0.1 (16 September, 2004):

- New methods (copyTextFile, copyReader, etc.) in org.clapper.util.io.FileUtil.
  copyTextFile() explicitly handles character set conversion.
- FileUtil copy methods no longer do their own buffering. They use the
  appropriate java.io.Buffered* classes, instead.
- Miscellaneous javadocs enhancements.


Version 1.0 (29 August, 2004):

- First version posted to the web.
