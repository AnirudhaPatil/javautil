CHANGELOG: org.clapper.util Java API

$Id$
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.1 (12 October, 2004)

- Added org.clapper.util.misc.JDK14TextLogFormatter class, a simple
  text log formatter for the 1.4 JDK java.util.logging infrastructure.

- Simplified loading of API version, in build.xml. Instead of loading
  version from Version.class, it now loads the version from a properties
  file. The Version class uses the same properties file, as a resource
  bundle.


Version 1.1 (07 October, 2004):

- Now requires JDK 1.4 or better. JDK 1.3 is no longer supported. Among
  the reasons for this requirement:

  * I wanted to use the new assertion capabilities of 1.4

  * The regular expression classes that come with 1.4 are more extensible
    than the Jakarta ORO classes; they work with anything that implements
    the CharSequence interface, not just with Strings. Plus, using
    java.util.regexp, instead of Jakarta ORO, removes a third-party library
    dependency.

  * The JDK 1.4 version of String introduces a split() method, obviating
    the need to provide those methods in TextUtil.

- Converted code that used Jakarta ORO to use the JDK 1.4 java.util.regexp
  classes. Includes introduction of new org.clapper.util.regex.RegexUtil
  class, which provides a substitute() method that takes the place of
  org.apache.oro.text.perl.Perl5Util's substitute() method.

- Added new org.clapper.util.misc.LRUMap class, which implements a simple
  least recently used map.

- org.clapper.util.misc.NestedException is now implemented in terms of the
  built-in exception chaining in the 1.4 JDK. NestedException is retained
  for backward compatibility and because it provides support for localizing
  exception messages.

- Added parseIntParameter(), parseIntOptionArgument(), parseFloatParameter(),
  parseFloatOptionArgument(), etc., parameter parsing helper methods to
  CommandLineUtility class.

- Overhauled build.xml to make compilations more efficient. Requires a
  newer version of Jikes (if compiling with Jikes).

- Cleaned up a lot of unnecessary imports. Addressed minor issues that
  Jikes warned about.

- Minor javadoc changes and adjustments.


Version 1.0.2 (24 September, 2004):

- Drastically simplified word-wrapping logic in org.clapper.io.WordWrapWriter.
- Added rightJustifyString(), leftJustifyString() and centerString() methods
  to org.clapper.util.text.TextUtil.
- Added org.clapper.util.io.JustifyTextWriter class.


Version 1.0.1 (16 September, 2004):

- New methods (copyTextFile, copyReader, etc.) in org.clapper.util.io.FileUtil.
  copyTextFile() explicitly handles character set conversion.
- FileUtil copy methods no longer do their own buffering. They use the
  appropriate java.io.Buffered* classes, instead.
- Miscellaneous javadocs enhancements.


Version 1.0 (29 August, 2004):

- First version posted to the web.
