<p>org.clapper.util.logging - Logging Classes.</p>
<p>This package contains logging-related classes. The
<a href="Logger.html"><tt>Logger</tt></a> class provides a front-end to
the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">Log4J</a> API,
insulating calling applications from the specifics of the underlying
logging layer, while providing a simpler, thinner interface than something
like <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">the Commons Logging
API</a>.
Other classes, such as
<a href="JavaUtilLoggingTextFormatter.html"><tt>JavaUtilLoggingTextFormatter</tt></a>,
provide useful formatters for the <tt>java.util.logging</tt> framework.</p>

<p>This API now wraps Log4J, rather than <tt>java.util.logging</tt> or
Jakarta Commons Logging, because the Log4J doesn't play odd games with
class loaders, as the other two APIs do. If you use your own class loader,
or you're running within a framework that substitutes its own class loader,
you can have problems with <tt>java.util.logging</tt> (which insists on
invoking the system class loader directly) and with Jakarta Commons Logging
(which misuses class loaders in its attempt to discover a suitable logging
API).</p>
