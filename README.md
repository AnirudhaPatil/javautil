*org.clapper.util* Java Utility Library
=======================================

The *org.clapper.util* Java Utility Library is a library of miscellaneous
utility classes and methods. As a general-purpose set of tools, this API is
a conceptual extension of the JDK. I use this library myself, so I
frequently update and revise its contents.

The library is Copyright &copy; 2004-2010, Brian M. Clapper, is released
